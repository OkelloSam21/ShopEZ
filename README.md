# ShopEZ
ShopEZ is a simple, intuitive Android shopping app built with Jetpack Compose. It demonstrates modern Android development practices and provides a smooth shopping experience for users.

Note:
The API has some endpoints that does nothing i.e adding item to cart, registering a user and many more. So some screens have UI implementation but no logic
Contributions are welcomed, because the app is far away from being good ðŸ˜‚

## Tech Stack.
Kotlin - Kotlin is a programming language that can run on JVM. Google has announced Kotlin as one of its officially supported programming languages in Android Studio; and the Android community is migrating at a pace from Java to Kotlin.

Jetpack components:

* -Jetpack Compose - Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
* - Android KTX - Android KTX is a set of Kotlin extensions that are included with Android Jetpack and other Android libraries. KTX extensions provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack, Android platform, and other APIs.
* - AndroidX - Major improvement to the original Android Support Library, which is no longer maintained.
* - Lifecycle - Lifecycle-aware components perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments. These components help you produce better-organized, and often lighter-weight code, that is easier to maintain.
* - ViewModel -The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* - Room database - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* - Preferences DataStore - Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.
* - Kotlin Coroutines - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.

* Retrofit - Retrofit is a REST client for Java/ Kotlin and Android by Square inc under Apache 2.0 license. Its a simple network library that is used for network transactions. By using this library we can seamlessly capture JSON response from web service/web API.
* GSON - JSON Parser,used to parse requests on the data layer for Entities and understands Kotlin non-nullable and default parameters.
* Kotlin Flow - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.
* Coil- An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
